Description: Recombination history is based on a mixture model that, given a pair
  of SNP-blocks, separates chromosomes in two populations, one with high Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
  and low recombination (linkage) and another with low LD and high recombination. The 
  method use the classification of several SNP-block pairs in a region to group chromosomes
  in clusters with different recombination history. This package takes as input genotype phased data.
